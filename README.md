# Squirrel-Vac
## A video game prototype created during the Global Game Jam, 2017 edition

Denise the Squirrel glides from treetop to treetop helping her friend Jerome to continue his endless journey without killing himself in the process.

Squirrel-Vac is a two player cooperative 3D video game where one player is air support, throwing acorn bombs that create a time-warping force field that slowdown the second player, thus facilitating more precise movements for their companion; and a second player is on the ground, playing a adventure endless runner while dodging and jumping over obstacles.
